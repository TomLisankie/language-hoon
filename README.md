# Hoon language support in Atom

---

**Rot Alert**

I abandoned this little project, but the nice people of Tlon took over! [Please visit the official repository.](https://github.com/urbit/language-hoon)

---

I simply converted the [SublimeHoon](https://github.com/alexflint/SublimeHoon/) project to Atom.

It's my first time using both [Hoon](http://urbit.org/docs/hoon/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) so I obviously have no idea what I'm doing.

Feel free to contribute!
